# J-NUX_J-OS_Reimplementation
The J-OS' Linux Implementation from the J-Project

# What is J-NUX?
J-NUX is the implementation of a Linux Distro for J-OS, A OS Project created by Lilly on the early days of 2023 for entretainment and development purposes.

# What is J-OS?
J-OS was a From Scratch project for creating a Non-*NIX Operative System, now re-implemented into a Linux-Distro built using LFS.

# Why to create this?
For pure entretainment and educational reasons.

There's no specific purpose for J-OS other than being a pure representation of why Lilly shouldn't be allowed to have access to a IDE and a Compiler.

# Releases?
They'll be out as soon as they are ready.
I won't push unstable builds of the software(that runs on top of Linux) unless i am certain it runs properly without causing system-unstability or random issues with other software.

# What is the "J" on "J-OS"?

Just a tag for "Just A" thing... a way to say this software is not needed, but nice to have, "Just A, Piece Of Software!" kinda thing.
On the context of "J-NIX" it means "Just A Linux" on the way to say "This Is Just Another Linux Distro".

# GUI Support?
As far as it goes Linux's support for GUI... if you want to go through the hell of compiling XOrg from source or decide to go with my really dumb DRM implementation, sure, go ahead...
if not, i would recommend you to just use the CLI... either way, is your option how you decide to use J-NIX and Theme it.

# Package Manager?
I will probably will end up using Pacman.
Open-Source and way easier to setup than whatever APT has goin'.

## And Last But Not Least?

# Why to use J-NIX?
There's no specific reason to why you "should" use J-NIX, it is just a Niche collection of software that runs on top of Linux's kernel and some tools to make some things slightly "easier"...

So in shorter words, there's no reason why you should use J-NIX instead of something like Debian or Ubuntu... use it if you want to, or not, nothing is forcing you here mate, just have fun and use what you feel is nice!.
