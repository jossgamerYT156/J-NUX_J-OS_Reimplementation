## this is the basic JSH example for non-j-based systems(specifically, J-NUX)
 ## What's JSH?
> JSH or **J**ust a **SH**ell Environment is a small program that runs as the shell environment on J-NUX systems, this is NOT the default SH, for security reasons.
> JSH is a OPTION of a SH environment which can be invoked by using `jsh` on the terminal of J-NUX.

JSH commands are mostly prefixed and can't be customized without editing the source code directly(because lilly doesn't know how to open dotfiles yet.)
so `OSINFO`, `dev` and `hlp` are UNCHANGABLE commands who are hardcoded on the JSH source.

## OSINFO Usage:
Type `OSINFO` on the terminal, it'll show you what's the OS name of J-OS!
As well it'll show you the LFS version of which J-NUX is running!.

## The `dev` command:

It just shows you who coded the shell environment... why's it there?
...
idk... but it's there so you know who coded JSH (if you ever wonder, of course)

## The `hlp` command:
Shows you the starting help message so you can start using JSH OOB!
